pycollada
=========

pycollada is a python module for creating, editing and loading
[COLLADA](http://www.collada.org/), which is a COLLAborative Design Activity
for establishing an interchange file format for interactive 3D applications.

The library allows you to load a COLLADA file and interact with it as a python
object. In addition, it supports creating a collada python object from scratch,
as well as in-place editing.

See the [pycollada Documentation](http://pycollada.github.com/) for more
